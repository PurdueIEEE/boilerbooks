	<h2>Boiler Books Guide</h2>
	<p>Boiler Books is an expense and income tracking system. It was developed on behalf of IEEE to track all purchases
		for the organization.</p>

		<p>The system allows any IEEE member to create an account and request to purchase something on behalf of the indicated committee.
			The purchase may then be approved or denied by the committee chair (or designated member). If the purchase is approved, the member will then
			proceed to buy the item. After it is bought the receipt shall be uploaded to allow for timely reimbursement by the IEEE treasurer.</p>

			<p>In addition to being a convenient system to request and approve purchases, members also have the ability to view all of their past purchases.
				Those with the appropriate permissions are also able to view purchases and income for their entire committee.</p>

				<p>Boiler Books is currently in Beta. There may be some features that are not currently available. Additionally, if you need access to something,
					would like to help develop Boiler Books, or have any questions or suggestions, please send us an
					<a href="mailto:ieee-officers@purdueieee.org">email</a>.</p>
