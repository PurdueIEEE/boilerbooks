    <h3>Income and Donation Home</h3>

      Report Income and Donations using the links on the sidebar. Income is money given
      to your committee. Donations are items or discounts that are non-monetary.

    <p class="lead">
      A quick rule-of-thumb: If you can spend it, it is Income and counts towards your balance.
      If you can use it, it is a donation and does not count towards your balance.

      Direct any questions towards the IEEE Treasurer.
