    <p class="lead fs-3">Boiler Books is an expense and income tracking system.</p>
    <p class="fs-5">
    It was developed on behalf of IEEE to track all purchases for the organization.
    The system allows any IEEE member to create an account and request to purchase
    something on behalf of the indicated committee.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
    In addition to being a convenient system to request and approve purchases, members
    also have the ability to view all of their past purchases. Those with the appropriate
    permissions are also able to view purchases and income for their entire committee.
    </p>
