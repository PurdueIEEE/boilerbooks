# v2 API Design

## Note

All actions should be able to be completed using only the API. In BBv1, actions are performed from the API and from the UI. To create a separable web application, all UI code should be decoupled from the API.

## Workflows

### Creating a User Account

1. User creates a user account
2. User account permisions can be elevated/lowered using ACLs
3. User views what purchases they have made

### Committee Budgeting

1. Committee Chair enters a budget
2. Committee Chair submits a budget
3. Treasurer approves a budget

### Committee Purchasing

1. User makes a purchase request
2. Committee Approvers approve purchase request
3. User completes purchase
4. Treasurer reimburses purchase

### Income Tracking

1. Income is reported by Officers OR Income is received by BOSO
2. Treasurer marks income status

### Financial Auditing

1. Treasurer and President view all financial transactions
2. Reports filterable based on committe, type, year
3. Committee Chairs view transactions for specific committee

### Dues Tracking

1. Users view their current paid dues
2. Committee Chairs view all dues paying members
3. Treasurer enters members into database
